Notes for Haskell
1, Expect a lot of errors, since the compiler of Haskell is extremely strick. This makes Haskell very safe.
2, Normally "not in scope" error means "cannot find the reference", or "your input format is wrong"
3, Functions cannot start with a uppercase letter
4, The :l in GHCI actually means :load, these two commands do the same thing
5, The :r in GHCI actually means :reload, these two commands do the same thing
6, The :t in GHCI actually means :type, these two commands do the same thing
